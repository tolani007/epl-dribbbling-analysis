# epl-dribbling-analysis
This is a short data story giving insights into the top and most efficient dribblers as of March 31st in the 22/23 season of the English premier league

Data was collected as of Frida March 31st, 2023.

I analyzed only players with at least the average number of appearances in form of minutes accrued.
I also analyzed only players with at least the average number of dribbles attempted.
In other words, the sample we would be evaluating would be performing better than the average dribbler on metrics of number of appearances and number of dribbles attempted.

To add another layer of analysis I will be highlighting the standard deviation of some metric values of some players to try to contextualize how well they are performing in dribbles compared to the average of said metrics.


What qualifies a player as a "top" dribbler?

Opinion: I think the main metrics to use to get this answer would be the dribble success percentage, number of successful dribbles and dribbles attempted as well as the averages for this metrics for more context on how well players are dribbling in comparison to the average of the population.

Is the best dribbler also the most efficient dribbler? 

Upon brainstorming I have decided to separate the "best" dribblers from the most "efficient" dribblers.
The number of successful dribbles would determine who would be the best dribbler.
The successful dribbles percentage would define who would be the most efficienct dribbler.

I will be analyzing "tackled on" metrics to reaffirm insights in initial analysis.

The general trend expressed in the chart above is players that attempt more dribbles tend to have more successful dribbles.

Main takeaways:

Wilfrid Zaha(30) is the best dribbler in the english premier league as of when this data was collected with 45 successful dribbles from 118 attempts.

Bukayo Saka(21) comes in second with 44 successful dribbles from 122 attempts.

Gabriel Martinelli(21) is 3rd with 42 successful dribbles from 97 attempts.

Other notable top dribblers under the age of 24 include: 

Michael Olise(21) with 38 successful dribbles from 94 attempts with 2 standard deviations above the average successful dribbles

Eberechi Eze(24) with 42 successful dribbles from 77 attempts with 2.4 standard deviations above the average successful dribbles

Brenden Aaronson(22) with 29 successful dribbles from 85 attempts with 1 standard deviations above the average successful dribbles

Marcus Tavernier(24) with 33 successful dribbles from 77 attempts with 1.1 standard deviations above the average successful dribbles

Morgan Gibbs-White with 32 successful dribbles from 71 attempts with 1.4 standard deviations above the average successful dribbles
