This is a short data story giving insights into the top and most efficient dribblers as of March 31st in the 22/23 season of the English premier league

Data was collected as of Frida March 31st, 2023.

I analyzed only players with at least the average number of appearances in form of minutes accrued.
I also analyzed only players with at least the average number of dribbles attempted.
To add another layer of analysis I will be highlighting the standard deviation of some metric values of some players to try to contextualize how well they are performing in dribbles compared to the average of said metrics.

What qualifies a player as a "top" dribbler?
Opinion: I think the main metrics to use to get this answer is the dribble success percentage, number of successful dribbles and dribbles attempted.

I will be analyzing "tackled on" metrics to reaffirm insights in initial analysis.
